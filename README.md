## Node Typescript Jest Starter

### I got inspired from Amenallah's blog post and extend a bit. Please check original blog [here](http://amenallah.com/node-js-typescript-jest-starter/)

Steps to use:
- Clone or download repo
- run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Scripts
- build: this will compile our Typescript code into ES5 and place it in the dist folder.
- start: will run the compiled es5, for production use mostly.
- dev: will run ts-node and watch for changes.
- test: will run Jest in watch mode.
- coverage: will generate the test coverage report and place it in the coverage folder by default
